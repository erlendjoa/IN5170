## 1

x <= 0 -> will not terminate.
x = 1 or x = 6 will terminate.
Final values are if x = 1 then 1, or if x = 6 then 6

## 2

0, 1 or -1. Final values are the initial values.

## 3

1. No, we are not guaranteed to have the statement go through.
2. No, because a deadlock can occur when an interleaving happens where x is set to below zero.
3. Only for strong fairness because we will infinitely often set x to 0.

## 4

Mutual exclusion, Absense of deadlock and absence of unnecessary delay. We do have eventual entry (because both threads will eventually enter) and absence of unnecessary delay.

## 5

Not mutualy exclusive,
Is absence of deadlock,
Is Absence of unnecessary delay
Not Eventual entry (if process is in inner while loop)

If delay is implemented then all (a) to (c) is in place, but still not eventual entry.
