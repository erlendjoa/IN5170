### Critical Section
- allows for interleavings
- await allows for mutual exclusion (one process access at a time)
- if guard holds, block other processes

<hr>

(Not all have to be satisified for every program)
- Mutual Exclusion: CS only accessed by one process at a time.
- Absence of deadlock: always checking condition but can never proceed.
- Absence of unnecessary delay: If processes want to access CS, one will succeed.
- Eventual entry: A process trying to enter CS will eventually succeed.

### Global invariant
### Atomic section

## Scheduling and fairness

1. Tie breaker algorithm
